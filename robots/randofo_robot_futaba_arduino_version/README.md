This is Randofo. A very cool and simple robot created by Randy Sarafan (His nick is Randofo in Instructables)

You can find the original version here:

http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Robot/

The original project uses Standar Servos from Radioshack. I created my own version of the body to use **futaba 3003 motors or similar and Arduino UNO or similar boards**

I also created a hardware control using Icestudio and the Icezum Alhambra, an open source FPGA board.
